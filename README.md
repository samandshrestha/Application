# Application

                                                


Algorithm:
Step1 : Start
Step2 :declare class as application
Step3:declare class Operations
Step4:declare bubble sort to sort file in ascending order
Step5:declare file listing function to list the file present
Step6: declare file delete function to delete the file 
Step7:declare file search function to search the file 
Step8:check whether the file is exists or not 
Step9:declare file creation function to create a file 
Step10:print some lines such as “*****”,”Welcome to LockMe.”,”*****”,”SAMAN SHRESTHA”.
Step11:while(true)
Step12:print “Please choose one of the following options:”
Step13:print “1. List  of current files present in ascending order”
Step14:print “2. Here are some user enabled operations”
Step15:print “3. Close the applications”
Step16:switch(ch)
Step17:if case 1: list function feature to list files in ascending order
Step18: if case 2:print”please  choose one of the following options:
Step18.1 print “1.Add a file”
Step18.2 print “2.Delete a file”
Step18.3 print  “3.Search for a file”
Step18.4 switch(choice)
Step18.4.1 case1: creation of file takes place
Step18.4.2 case 2:deletion of files takes place
Step18.4.3 case 3:search for a file takes place
Step19: if case 3:exiting the application
Step 20: Stop

SCRUM

Sprints3:

Sprint number(1-3):  Product story : Collect the requirement such that the user story about the application 

In each sprint create a reasonable product. Design product diagram, design and test.

Sprint planning with Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team. Daily Scrum to discuss and evaluate the progress.

Sprint Review: Feedback and collaborations. At  end of each week for 3 week. At the end of 3rd week, the product is presented to the product owner for acceptance or refusal

Sprint Retrospective : Meeting to plan and decide on enhancing and integrating in the next project.


The core concepts and algorithms used to complete this application

Code to display the welcome screen. 
The details of the user interface.
Features to accept the user input
The first option should return the current file names in ascending order.
The second option should return options displaying the following:
Add a file to the existing directory list
Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list
Search a user specified file from the main directory
Display the result on successful
Display the result on unsuccessful operation
Option to navigate back to the main context
There should be a third option to close the application

Implement of  appropriate concepts as following:
 Esxceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance
